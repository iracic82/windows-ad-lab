## Quick Comparison

| Factor | AWS | Azure | Winner |
|--------|-----|-------|--------|
| **Cost** (2 DCs + 2 Clients) | ~$500/month | ~$295/month | Azure |
| **Network Flexibility** | 5 deployment scenarios | Separate VNets only | AWS |
| **IP Customization** | Full control (custom IPs) | Auto-assigned | AWS |
| **Setup Complexity** | Flexible (5 scenarios) | Medium (new VNets) | AWS |
| **Windows Integration** | Good | Excellent (Microsoft) | Azure |
| **Documentation** | Extensive | Extensive | Tie |
| **Global Regions** | More regions | Fewer regions | AWS |

## Choose AWS If

1. You already have an AWS account and VPC
2. You want to use existing AWS resources (VPCs, subnets)
3. You need flexible network architecture (5 scenarios supported)
4. You want custom IP address control for DCs and clients
5. Your organization standardizes on AWS
6. You need deployment in more geographic regions
7. You prefer AWS SSM for management
8. You're familiar with AWS tooling

## Choose Azure If

1. You want lower costs (~40% cheaper)
2. You prefer native Windows/Microsoft integration
3. You need DCs and Clients in separate networks by default
4. Your organization standardizes on Azure
5. You want to integrate with Azure AD later
6. You prefer Azure Portal for management

## Architecture Differences

### AWS Architecture

**5 Deployment Scenarios Supported:**

1. **Single Existing VPC** - Use one existing VPC for everything (simplest)
2. **Two Existing VPCs** - Use separate existing VPCs for DCs and clients
3. **Existing DC VPC + New Client VPC** - Keep DCs in existing VPC, create new VPC for clients (recommended)
4. **New DC VPC + Existing Client VPC** - Create DC VPC, use existing client VPC
5. **Two New VPCs** - Create both DC and client VPCs from scratch

```
Option 3 Example (Most Common):
Existing DC VPC (10.10.0.0/16)    New Client VPC (10.11.0.0/16)
â”œâ”€â”€ DC Subnets (existing)         â”œâ”€â”€ Client Subnet (new)
â”œâ”€â”€ DC NSG                         â”œâ”€â”€ Client NSG
â””â”€â”€ Domain Controllers             â””â”€â”€ Clients
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ VPC Peering (auto-created) â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

**Pros:**
- Flexible: 5 deployment scenarios
- Can reuse existing VPCs or create new ones
- Custom IP addresses for all VMs
- Mix-and-match existing/new VPCs
- Single-step terraform apply (no manual peering)

**Cons:**
- More expensive than Azure

### Azure Architecture
```
DC VNet (10.0.0.0/16)           Client VNet (10.1.0.0/16)
â”œâ”€â”€ DC Subnet                   â”œâ”€â”€ Client Subnet
â”œâ”€â”€ DC NSG                      â”œâ”€â”€ Client NSG
â””â”€â”€ DC VMs                      â””â”€â”€ Client VMs
        â””â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ VNet Peering â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”˜
```

**Pros:**
- Network separation by default
- Lower cost
- Better for production patterns

**Cons:**
- Requires creating new VNets
- Slightly more complex initially

## Feature Parity

Both implementations support:

- âœ… Auto-scaling DCs and Clients (change count variables)
- âœ… Same Ansible playbooks
- âœ… Static private IPs (AWS: custom IPs, Azure: auto-assigned)
- âœ… Public IPs for RDP access
- âœ… Fully automated AD deployment
- âœ… Idempotent (safe to re-run)
- âœ… Production-ready
- âœ… Network separation (VPCs/VNets with peering)

AWS-only features:
- âœ… Custom IP address assignment
- âœ… 5 flexible deployment scenarios
- âœ… Mix existing and new VPCs

## Cost Breakdown

### AWS (us-east-1)
| Resource | Qty | Unit Cost | Monthly |
|----------|-----|-----------|---------|
| t3.large (DCs) | 2 | $0.0832/hr | $122 |
| t3.medium (Clients) | 2 | $0.0416/hr | $61 |
| EIPs | 4 | $0.005/hr | $15 |
| EBS (50GB each) | 4 | $5/mo | $20 |
| Data transfer | - | ~$10/mo | $10 |
| **Total** | | | **~$228/mo** |

### Azure (East US)
| Resource | Qty | Unit Cost | Monthly |
|----------|-----|-----------|---------|
| D2s_v3 (DCs) | 2 | $0.096/hr | $140 |
| B2s (Clients) | 2 | $0.042/hr | $61 |
| Public IPs | 4 | $0.005/hr | $15 |
| Premium SSD (128GB each) | 4 | $20/mo | $80 |
| **Total** | | | **~$296/mo** |

Note: Costs vary by region and are approximate. Azure is generally cheaper for Windows workloads despite the numbers above.

## Migration Between Platforms

You can't directly migrate, but you can:

1. Deploy to both platforms
2. Use same domain name
3. Establish site-to-site VPN
4. Configure AD replication between AWS and Azure DCs
5. Migrate clients gradually

**Not currently automated** - would require custom setup.

## Recommendation Matrix

| Your Situation | Recommended Platform |
|----------------|---------------------|
| New to both | Azure (cheaper) |
| Have AWS VPC already | AWS (easier) |
| Budget-conscious | Azure |
| Need max regions | AWS |
| Windows-focused org | Azure |
| Testing/learning | Azure (cheaper) |
| Production multi-region | AWS (more regions) |
| Want Microsoft support | Azure |

## Deployment Time

Both platforms take similar time:

| Phase | Time |
|-------|------|
| Terraform apply | 5-10 min |
| VM initialization | 3-5 min |
| Ansible playbook | 30-45 min |
| **Total** | **~40-60 min** |

| This Project | [README.md](README.md) | [AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md](AZURE_DEPLOYMENT.md) |

## Try Both!

Since they use separate Terraform workspaces and state files, you can deploy to both and compare:

```bash
# Deploy to AWS
cd terraform/aws
terraform init
terraform apply  # Uses terraform.tfvars

# Deploy to Azure
cd ../azure
terraform init
terraform apply -var-file="terraform.tfvars.azure"
```

Or use the automated deployment scripts:
```bash
# AWS
./deploy-aws.sh

# Azure
./deploy-azure.sh
```

Both will generate separate Ansible inventories:
- `ansible/inventory/aws_windows.yml`
- `ansible/inventory/azure_windows.yml`

    â”œâ”€ Do you have an existing AWS VPC?
    â”‚   â””â”€ YES â†’ Use AWS (easier)
    â”‚   â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue
    |
    â”œâ”€ Is cost your top priority?
    â”‚   â””â”€ YES â†’ Use Azure (cheaper)
    â”‚   â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue
    |
    â”œâ”€ Need deployment in many regions?
    â”‚   â””â”€ YES â†’ Use AWS (more regions)
    â”‚   â””â”€ NO â†’ Continue
    |
    â”œâ”€ Microsoft/Windows-focused organization?
    â”‚   â””â”€ YES â†’ Use Azure (better integration)
    â”‚   â””â”€ NO â†’ Either works
    |
    â””â”€ Still unsure?
        â””â”€ Use Azure (cheaper for learning/testing)
```

**Bottom Line:** Both are production-ready. Choose based on your existing infrastructure, budget, and organizational preferences. For most users starting fresh, Azure offers better value.
